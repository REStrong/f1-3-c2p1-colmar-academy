Final problems:
1) images would not autoscale
2) issues managing menubar so that items were evenly spaced - they were all clumped to the left
3) did not have time to play with fonts and colors
4) problems formatting the button - it would not align with the other flexbox items, and it's colors were weird
5) did not have time to add alt text and readability to make it more accessible to screen readers
6) different browsers read it differently
7) it's not perfect, but it's all I had time for
